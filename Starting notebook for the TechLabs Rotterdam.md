Starting notebook for the TechLabs Rotterdam AI 2022 course

In this repo we will elaborate on code bits that we have either individually or jointly created and work towards the completion of small AI projects.

As a first exercise, I'd like you all to create files in your local branch and to push & commit them to the main branch online. 

Hey Marvin, I already pulled the python file I made to the main branch. I took one step more accidentally. In this case, for this .md file I will just stage the changes and commit & push them.
